# YouTube Clone (frontend)
This YouTube clone partner project allows users to search for a video, see the title and descrpition, view five related videos, and see or post comments and replies to comments. Users can like or dislike comments as well. These comments are not actual comments from the YouTube video, rather comments and replies were maintained in a MySQL database that interacts with the backend Django REST API.
